            <h2 class="title">Origin of Hindu Calendar</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The origin of the Indian calendar is a testament to the rich cultural and historical heritage of India. Dating back thousands of years, the Indian calendar has evolved through various phases, each influenced by different dynasties, religions, and astronomical advancements.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest Indian calendars was the Vedic calendar, which was lunar-based and rooted in the religious rituals of the Vedic period. Over time, this calendar system evolved into the Hindu calendar, known as the "Panchanga," incorporating lunar months, solar years, and a complex system of intercalation.</p>
                <p>The Gupta dynasty played a significant role in refining the Indian calendar, incorporating advancements in astronomy. Later, the Islamic influence led to the development of the Islamic Hijri calendar in certain regions of India.</p>
                <p>The Indian National Calendar, also known as the Saka calendar, was adopted as the official civil calendar in 1957. It is a solar calendar based on the tropical year and is closely tied to the Gregorian calendar used worldwide.</p>
